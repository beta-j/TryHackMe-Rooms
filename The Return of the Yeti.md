# The Return of the Yeti #
## The Yeti needs a plan for 2023. Help him out! ##

>Christmas 2023 is already just around the corner. The Bandit Yeti has been sleeping for most of the year to prepare to hack back into the Best Festival Company. Should he have used that time to plan his attack? Probably. But Yetis need a lot of energy, so don't judge!

This room was included as one of the sidequests for the TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2023.  We are given [a network capture file; `VanSpy.pcapng`](assets/VanSpy.pcapng) and tasked with answering the following questions:

>What's the name of the WiFi network in the PCAP?
>
>What's the password to access the WiFi network?
>
>What suspicious tool is used by the attacker to extract a juicy file from the server?
>
>What is the case number assigned by the CyberPolice to the issues reported by McSkidy?
>
>What is the content of the yetikey1.txt file?
