>Christmas 2023 is already just around the corner. The Bandit Yeti has been sleeping for most of the year to prepare to hack back into the Best Festival Company. Should he have used that time to plan his attack? Probably. But Yetis need a lot of energy, so don't judge!

This room was included as one of the sidequests for the TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2023.  We are given [a network capture file; `VanSpy.pcapng`](assets/VanSpy.pcapng) and tasked with answering the following questions:

**NOTE :** Passwords, hashes and flags are redacted in this document.  If you'd like to know the answers simply go to the [TryHackMe Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/adv3nt0fdbopsjcap) and follow the steps - it's free ðŸ˜„

## PROCEDURE : ##

We are given a file called [VanSpy.pcapng](assets/VanSpy.pcapng).  PCAPNG (a.k.a. "PCAP Next Generation", "pcap-ng" or ".pcapng") is a file format for network captures that has some improvements over the regular PCAP files we're accustomed to.  Luckily these files can still be handled by [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and we can aslo use it [to convert from one fromat to the other]([url](https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2012-12&post=HowTo-handle-PcapNG-files)https://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2012-12&post=HowTo-handle-PcapNG-files).  So we can go ahead and fire-up Wireshark and start examining the newtwork capture we've been given.

### Part 1 - Retrieving the WiFi SSID ###

For the time being we can't see much as most of the traffic is encrypted, but we can start working towards answering the first couple of questions.  [Aircrack-NG](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/) is an excellent tool for this.  it comes pre-installed with Kali Linux distributions and can be used to analyse network captures and extract valuable information about wifi networks.  however Aircrack-NG does not accept PCAPNG files as its input (yet) - so first we need to convert our PCAPNG to a regular PCAP by going to **File** -> **Save As** in Wireshark and selecting ***Modified tcpdump -pcap*** in the **Save as type:** field and saving the file as `VanSpy.pcap`.  Now we can go to ur Linux terminal and examine the PCAP file with Aircrack-NG:
```
$ aircrack-ng VanSpy.pcap  
Reading packets, please wait...
Opening VanSpy.pcap
Read 45243 packets.

   #  BSSID              ESSID                     Encryption

   1  22:C7:12:C7:E2:35  FreeWifiBFC               WPA (1 handshake)

Choosing first network as target.

Reading packets, please wait...
Opening VanSpy.pcap
Read 45243 packets.

1 potential targets

Please specify a dictionary (option -w).
```

That's great - from just one (very short) command we already have the answer to the first question.  The name of the WiFi network is **`FreeWifiBFC`**.

#  

### Part 2 - Retrieving the WiFi Password ###

Aircrack-NG also makes answering the next question quite simple for us.  Provided that our capture file contains a succesful WiFi handshake in it, we can use the same tool to brute-force and extract the WiFi password.  We'll need to specify a *wordlist* for this command (i.e. a list of words that the program will attempt to use as passwords).  The most popular wordlist to use for such attacks especially CTF challenges is [`rockyou.txt`](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt) which includes some of the most commonly used passwords.
```
$ aircrack-ng VanSpy.pcap -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

After just a couple of seconds Aircrack-NG has retrieved the WiFi password for us (Admittedly it was an easy password to crack):
```
                               Aircrack-ng 1.7 

      [00:00:18] 31526/14344392 keys tested (1726.75 k/s) 

      Time left: 2 hours, 18 minutes, 8 seconds                  0.22%

                           KEY FOUND! [ C******** ]


      Master Key     : C4 BB 8C DA 66 C3 72 E6 C2 86 14 84 6E 2B 03 EC 
                       3D 00 2E A7 DE 31 96 BA 86 3A 47 4D 63 3A 48 75 

      Transient Key  : B2 F3 33 91 8A 56 EA 1C 5F BA 8A D7 19 9D A4 62 
                       BA 0A CE C1 46 85 AC 59 4D 38 EA 60 BD D2 88 0B 
                       6A 21 CD 84 B1 A5 07 EA 8F 8B B7 17 B7 DF F4 A2 
                       D8 F3 61 53 32 87 A0 0D 87 78 38 A3 C4 60 E9 B6 

      EAPOL HMAC     : AA CD A8 56 3F 4B AC 08 C8 B1 B8 74 0B 52 2E 6C 
```

So to answer the second question, the WiFi password is **`C********`**

#  
### Part 3 - Decrypting and Analysing WiFi Traffic ###

Now that we have a WiFi password we're going to need to decrypt the WiFi traffic in the network capture to be able to continue our investigation further.  To do this in Wireshark go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Protocols** > **IEEE 802.11** and click on the **Edit** button next to *Decryption Keys*.  Click on the `+` sign at the bottom left corner and select *Key type* : `wpa-pwd` and enter the password in the format `password:SSID`.  So in our case this will be `C********:FreeWifiBFC`. Then click on **OK**.

![image](https://github.com/beta-j/TryHackMe-Rooms/assets/60655500/42718960-4238-4466-af1d-6f92b2586ba8)

We can confirm that this has worked because now we are also able to see other traffic apart from 802.11 protocol.  We can now also see things like `ICMP`, `ARP` and more interestingly `TCP` and `TLSv1.2`.

Let's have a closer look at the story that this network capture is telling us.  
1.  **Packets `1` to `331`:** The first packets in the capture are WiFi beacon frames advertising the BSSID and negotiating the handshake (the one we cracked earlier).
2.  **Packets `332` to `335`:** Once the attacker connected to the Wifi we see some ARP traffic as the ARP table is updated with the attacker's MAC and IP addresses.
3.  **Packets `337` to `39981`:** Then we immediately see a *Remote Desktop Protocol* (RDP) session as evidenced by the use of TCP Port 3389.  All of this traffic is encrypted over the RDP session (we'll have more fun with this later).
4.  **Packets `39983` to `43952`:** Next we see a lot of traffic from the attacker's port `35827` to multiple different victim port numbers.  Most likely the attacker was performing a port scan here.
5.  **Packets `44021` to `45192`:** Finally we see sustained traffic to/from Port `4444`. 

For those who are familiar with cybersecurity and pentesting tools, this rings some alarm bells as port `4444` is an easy-to-remember port number that is very commonly used when establishing reverse shells.  It is helpful to filter for this traffic in Wireshark by using the filter; ``tcp.port == 4444``. Now - ignoring the first three packets in the resulting list (as these were part of the initial port scan and not the TCP conversation we're interested in), we can right-click on one of the packets further down the list and select **Follow** > **TCP Stream**.  This gives us a nice cleartext view of what went on in this session:

Now it's easy to see what the attacker was up to as we have the all the Powershell commands and outputs in cleartext infront of us.  Of particular interest is that he downloaded and executed `mimikatz.exe` which is a tool that is used to extract user crredentials from a system's memory.  From the output of `mimikatz.exe` we can also see that he succesfully retrieved a pfx certificate file called `LOCAL_MACHINE_Remote Desktop_0_INTERN-PC.pfx`.   This answers the thrid question of this room.  

The suspicious tool that the attacker used to extract a juicy file from the server was **`mimikatz`**

#  

### Part 4 - Decrypting and Replaying a RDP Session ###

From the Powershell output we just got to examine, we can see that the attacker retrieved a pfx certificate file and converted the contents *to* base64.  We can simply copy the cleartext output of this operation and convert it back *from* base64 to recreate the pfx file.  An easy way of doing this is to use [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) with the **From Base64** Recipe element.  Just paste the copied base64 string in the **Input** box and then click on the *Save* icon on the Output box to save the resulting output to a pfx file - which we are going to call `certificate.pfx`.

![image](https://github.com/beta-j/TryHackMe-Rooms/assets/60655500/7d273931-4096-4fb7-bbb1-44f421ddae88)

Now we can use this certificate file ro decrypt the RDP traffic in Wireshark similarly to what we did to decrypt the WiFi traffic in [Part 3](#part-3---decrypting-and-analysing-wifi-traffic).  In Wireshark go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Protocols** > **TLS** and click on the **Edit** button next to *RSA keys list*.  For port enter `3389` which is the standard RDP port, for protocol enter `tpkt`, for the *Key File* browse to the `certificate.pfx` file we just created and for the *Password* enter `mimikatz` since this is the default password applied by Mimikatz when using it to extract certificates.

Now for the most interesting part of this challenge...

After some hours of research on what to do next I came across this ingenious project called [**PyRDP**](https://github.com/GoSecure/pyrdp) which will generate a video replay from a decrypted RDP session's network capture - which is exactly what we're after!

To install PyRDP we can clone into the project's repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/GoSecure/pyrdp
```

Then follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/GoSecure/pyrdp/blob/main/docs/devel.adoc) to get all the necessary dependancies installed:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv build-essential python3-dev git openssl libgl1-mesa-dev libnotify-bin libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-util1 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libswresample-dev libavfilter-dev
```

Reboot our machine:
```
sudo reboot 0
```

Then install pyrdp in a virtual environment:
```
cd pyrdp
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -U pip setuptools wheel
pip3 install -U -e '.[full]'
```
**NOTE:**  *I tried several different ways of installing and running PyRDP incuding a Docker install and using `pipx`, but I could only get it to work without issues with the method described above* 


Before passing on the pcap file to PyRDP we need to extract the decrypted RDP session PDUs.  This can easily be done in Wireshark by going to **File** > **Export PDUs to File**, then selecting **OSI layer 7** in the dropdown menu and clicking on **OK**.  Wireshark will now only show us the PDUs related to the RDP session as a new capture file and we can **File** > **Save As** to save it as a new PCAP file; in our case `osil7extract.pcap` (Remember to select the *Wireshark /tcpdump/...-pcap* format when saving).

Now we can use PyRDP's 'convertor' tool to convert our PCAP file to a format that the PyRDP player can parse as a video.
```
# pyrdp-convert ../osil7extract.pcap

...and finally we can look at the generated _playback video and keylogs!_:
```
pyrdp-player 20231125145052_10.0.0.2:55510-10.1.1.1:3389.pyrdp

Isn't that really cool?!  Sometimes we get so used to running and exploring everything trhough CLI that when we come across something as visual as that, it's really impressive.  Just ***imagine how impactful a video like that could be as part of a pentest report!***  It is also possible to output the video-replay to a MP4 file using the following syntax: `pyrdp-convert ../osil7extract.pcap -f mp4` which makes it easier to share with third parties.  

We're really close to completing this challenge now.  PyRDP provides us with more information than we could ever ask for - video playback, keystroke logs and clipboard monitoring!  Just by looking through the video generated by PyRDP, we see that our attacker opened Google Chrome and accessed Gmail.  He logged in as `mcskidyelf@gmail.com` with the password `j!*********` and opened an email with the subject line **RE: Suspicious activity** recieved from **Cyber Police**.  In this email we see that the case number assigned is `31337-0`, which he copies to clipboard.  He then replies to the email saying that he will be sending them a copy of a *"weird file"* through a *"more secure channel"*.  He also copies this email to the clipboard - so it is most likely that we could have extracted this info from the capture if we were more patient (and wanted to settle for a much less cool result).

At this point we have enough information to answer the fourth question.  The case number assigned by the CyberPolice to the issues reported by McSkidy is **`31337-0`**.

Next he closes the Chrome browser, opens Powershell and navigates to the `DESKTOP` folder. He lists the contents of the `DESKTOP` folder and copies the filename for `yetikey1.txt`.  Then he appears to paste in a Powershell command he copied from an other terminal; ``Set-Clipboard-value(Get-Content .\Desktop\secret.txt.txt)`` and edits this to read ``Set-Clipboard-value(Get-Content .\Desktop\yetikey1.txt)`` and runs the command three times.  This updates the clipboard with the contents of `yetikey`.txt` - which we can conventiently see from the clipboard monitoring in PyRDP player.

And this gives us the answer to the fifth and final question of this challenge; the content of `yetikey1.txt` is **`1-...<R E D A C T E D>...ef2834`**
